## Milestone 1

### Summary Update

This week, the team brainstormed several possible project ideas such as tools for code coverage, generating call graphs, code
smell identifier, UML diagram generator, etc. After discussions with our TA, we settled on the idea of creating a tool which dynamically 
tracks the values and types of JavaScript variables over the course of a program's execution and display this information in a dynamic way.
One use-case for this program analysis would be to help developers debug their programs. Additionally, this could be an educational tool
to teach new programmers about type coercion in JavaScript. This would be a dynamic analysis project with a visualization component. 
The team is also continuing to brainstorm possible static analysis components that we could incorporate into this idea. 

### Next Steps
    * Describe what type of programs the project will handle (eg. string, ints, objects) and features we want to target (eg. control flow)
    * Describe what the visualization will look like
    * Begin investigating JavaScript AST and frameworks we may want to utilize
    * Planned timeline of implementation and division of labour
